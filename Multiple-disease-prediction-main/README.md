# MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are playing a huge role in
todayâ€™s world. From self-driving cars
to medical fields, we can find them
everywhere. The medical industry generates a huge amount of patient data which can be processed in a lot of ways. So, with the help of machine learning, we have created a Prediction System that can detect more than one disease at a time. Many of the existing systems can predict only one disease at a time and that too with lower accuracy. Lower accuracy can seriously put a patientâ€™s health in danger. We have considered three diseases for now that are Heart, Parkinsons, and Diabetes and in the future, many more diseases can be added. The user has to enter various parameters of the disease and the system would display the output whether he/she has the disease or not. This project can help a lot of people as one can monitor the personsâ€™ condition and take the necessary precautions thus increasing the life expectancy.
